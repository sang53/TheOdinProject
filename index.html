    <h1>The Odin Project Main Page</h1>
    Welcome to the main page for my webpages created for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project!</a>
    <br>
    This page lists all the projects I have made for the project, as well as the main learning points.
    <br>
    The projects are listed in chronological order, so the projects listed earlier will be simpler with less concepts.

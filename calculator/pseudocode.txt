stages to control behaviour:
    stage 0 - input first number
    stage 1 - input second number
    stage 2 - valid equals was pressed

main functions - ended up grouping by stage --> button instead for better clarity

handleOperators:
    clear (stage - any):
        reset stored values
        update prevdiv to empty string
        update outputdiv to 0
    backspace (stage - 0, 1):
        remove 1 character from outputdiv
        if outputdiv is empty, replace with 0
    equals (stage - 1):
        if both numbers & operator is inputted:
            store outputdiv
            calculate answer
            update prevdiv to both numbers and operator
            update outputdiv to answer
            store answer

    others (stages - any):
        store outputdiv
        reset outputdiv
        update prevdiv to old outputdiv + operator


handleNumbers:
    +/- (stage - any):
        if outputdiv starts with -:
            remove - from outputdiv
        else:
            add - to outputdiv
    period - (stages 0, 1):
        add . to outputdiv
        disallow .
    others - (stages 0, 1):
        add number to outputdiv
        
        stage 2:
            clear
            add number to outputdiv

helper functions:

clear() - reset stored memory, remove opacity of all elements

updateOutput(num=0) - update outputdiv to num

updateprev(str) - update prevdiv to str

toggleOpacity(element, num=1) - toggle opacity of element to show valid/invalid buttons at different stages. default to removing opacity.

calculate() - return calculated value according to stored values & operator

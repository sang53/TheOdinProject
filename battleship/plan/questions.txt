in ship-placement:
  is it better to add ships directly to board
  or keep it as a in-module data structure and assign into board when confirming ships

  use optional default arguments to allow testing & modularity? 
  Eg, board = PLAYERS[currTurn].board, lastPlaced = lastPlaced

  matchHangarOrient -> should it return true/false, then do the consequent action (rotate ship) in the calling/main function
  or rotate ships directly inside matchHangarOrient function

Shot-select:
  pass in shots Set in registerShots() or just assign to global variable shots.
  could do either

DOM:
  toggleShips => hides & unhides ships 
  or is it better to have hideShips() + showShips()

General:
  where to put code that manipulates DOM.
  eg - when a ship is deselected => remove class "selected"
     - when a ship is placed => append ship to square & add class "placed"
